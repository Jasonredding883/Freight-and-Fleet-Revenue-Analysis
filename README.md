# Freight & Fleet Revenue Analysis ðŸš›ðŸ“Š

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project explores a logistics dataset (sourced from Kaggle) to understand **fleet performance, costs, and revenue**.  
The workflow combines **Python** for data cleaning and preparation with **Tableau** for creating interactive dashboards.  

The goal was to replicate a realistic data analyst workflow:
1. Clean and prepare messy files using Python (Pandas).
2. Load structured datasets into Tableau.
3. Build an interactive revenue dashboard to uncover insights.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Skills Demonstrated
- **Python (Pandas):** data cleaning, formatting, and preprocessing.
- **Tableau:** interactive dashboards, KPIs, and revenue analysis.

---

## ðŸ”„ Workflow
### 1. Python Data Cleaning
- Loaded a mixture of csv and excel files via kagglehub.
- Split the excel files into manageable tables.
- Inspected the tables 
- Converted European-style decimals (e.g., `7,42` â†’ `7.42`).
- Removed duplicate and null rows.
- Exported cleaned datasets for Tableau (`/data/cleaned/`).

### 2. Tableau Dashboard
- Built an **interactive revenue dashboard** combining revenue, costs, and KPIs.
- Added filters for **Year, Truck Type, Driver and Truck ID** to drill down into performance.
- Designed visualisations for:
  - Revenue trends by year
  - Revenue per truck type
  - Top customers by revenue 
  - KPIs
